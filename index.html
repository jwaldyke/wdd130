        <p>The State of Colorado is filled with beautiful mountain landscapes. People visit my state to enjoy nature by hiking the Rocky Mountain trails, white water rafting on the Arkansas River, or relaxing in Strawberry Park hot springs. The number of outdoor activities can feel endless because Colorado is know for having 300+ days of sunshine every year. Colorado's key industries are aerospace, technology, renewable energy, tourism and agricultre.  </p>
