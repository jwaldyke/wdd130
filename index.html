            <p>Hi! My name is Jennifer and I live in Lakewood, Colorado. I love spending time outdoors with my husband,
                Dan,
                and our dog, Edna.
                She loves to be around us and join me in my profile picture. We have two sons, Matthew and Wyatt.
                Matthew is
                a return missionary
                and attending school. Wyatt is currently serving his mission. They are both amazing young men. My life
                is
                filled with family and
                friends. Everywhere I go I am surrounded by either or both. I love my Savior, Jesus Christ and am so
                grateful for all that He
                has given me. I have been a mom and worked in the small group health insurance business. Since my
                children
                are starting their own lives, I made the decision to change the direction of my career. This lead me to
                BYU Pathway.
                I am so excited to try something new that I have never done before. </p>

            <p>The State of Colorado is filled with beautiful mountain landscapes. People visit my state to enjoy nature
                by
                hiking the Rocky Mountain trails, white water rafting on the Arkansas River, or relaxing in Strawberry
                Park
                hot springs. The number of outdoor activities can feel endless because Colorado is know for having 300+
                days
                of sunshine every year. Colorado's key industries are aerospace, technology, renewable energy, tourism
                and
                agricultre. </p>
